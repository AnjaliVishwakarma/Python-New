Q. What is python?
A. Python is a simple and high level programming language

Programming languages are of two types:

1. Low level programming languages: These are the programming languages which are understandable
by the machine only because their code is written in bytes format

2. High level programming languages: These are the programming languages which are understandable
by the user

Q. What is the use of any programming language?
A. The use of any programming language is to create software

Q. What are the different types of softwares?
A. The softwares are generally of two types:

    1. Character User Interface (CUI): In the softwares, the commands are provided by typing
    them through the keyboard. 
    Examples are: cmd on windows, Linux, Unix, MS DOS etc
    
    Advantages:
    They are fast and use less resources on the system
    
    Disadvantages:
    They are not user friendly
    
    
    2. Graphical User Interface (GUI): These are the applications where we can interact with the 
    screen of the program
    Examples: Pycharm, Paint, PowerPoint, etc.
    
    Advantages:
    They are user-friendly and easy to use
    
    Disadvantages:
    They use a lot of resources on the system
    
    The GUI Application are further divided into two types:
        
        a. Desktop Based Applications: These are the applications which can be installed on 
        our machines and can be used as stand-alone applications
        
        There is a module in python called TKinter which is used to create desktop based 
        applications
        
        
        b. Web Based Applications: These are the application which cannot be installed on our
        machine and they need browser to run
        
        They are created with the help of DJango module / Framework
