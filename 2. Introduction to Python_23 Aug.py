Q. What is the basic requirement from a software?
A. The basic requirements are:
1. Take input from the user
2. Provide output to the user

Q. How is the data saved in a machine?
A. Data is saved with the help of variables.

Q. What are variables?
A. Variables are a technique which are used to store data in the memory

Memory:
It is of two types:

RAM : Random Access Memory : It is the primary memory of the machine. It is volatile in nature
ROM : Read Only Memory : It is the secondary memory of the machine. It is permanent in nature

Q. How are memory locations assigned to data in the RAM?
A. There are basically 2 different techniques that the programming languages follow to assign
memory to a variable / value in RAM:

1. Static memory Allocation: In static memory allocation once the memory location is assigned 
to a variable, then it remains fixed with it and cannot be changed.

2. Dynamic Memory Allocation: Here, one the memory location is assigned to a variable, it can 
be changed later on.
Python follows dynamic memory allocation

Q. Are there different types of variables?
A. Yes, they are:

1. Value type variables: These are the variables which directly store the value in them

2. Reference type variables: These are the variables which hold the address of the memory
location in which the values are saved
Python uses reference type variables

Q. What are the steps to create variables in any programming language?
A. There are 5 steps to create variables. They are:

Step 1:
The program will determine how much amount of memory is required to save the value

Step 2: 
The program will go into the RAM and search for the required amount of memory

Step 3:
The program will reserve that memory location

Step 4:
Values will be stored at those memory locations

Step 5:
Variables are assigned to the memory locations


Types of programming languages:

1. Compiler Based: There are 2 entities, Compiler and Kernel. The Compiler converts the user-
understandable code into machine understandable byte code. After that the Kernel will execute 
the machine understandable byte code.

2. Interpreter Based: There is only 1 entity, i.e., the Interpreter. It runs the code line 
by line from top to bottom in order
Python is an interpreter based language
